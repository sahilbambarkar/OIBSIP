                During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors, nurses, and frontline healthcare workers have shown resilience
                and unwavering dedication in fighting the virus. They have been the backbone of global health systems,
                saving lives and providing care when the world needed it most.
            </p>
            <p class="tribute-text">
                Working long hours, often without proper rest, they sacrificed their own safety and well-being to ensure
                that their patients were taken care of. From administering life-saving treatments to offering emotional
                support to patients and families, they have displayed extraordinary commitment.

                These healthcare heroes are not just workers; they are warriors in scrubs, shielding the world from the
                unknown. They provided a light in times of darkness, a ray of hope in despair. The fight was tough, but
                they were tougher.
            </p>

            <p class="tribute-text">
                Their service will never be forgotten, and we owe them a debt of gratitude that cannot be repaid in
                words alone. Every mask worn, every hand washed, and every life saved is a testament to their strength.
